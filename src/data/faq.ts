    question: 'Who is Manas AI for?',
    answer:
      'Startups, brands, and agencies who recognize that AI is reshaping their landscape and want to move with intention. We work best with ambitious, action-oriented teams — and with the genuinely curious who may not yet know where to start but are ready to explore. If you\'re waiting for permission or consensus, we\'re probably not the right fit. If you\'re already moving, we\'ll help you move with precision.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What does an engagement typically look like?',
    answer:
      'It starts with a conversation — no formal pitch decks or intake forms. We learn how you think, where you\'re headed, and what\'s blocking you. From there, engagements take shape organically: some begin as a focused strategy sprint and evolve into ongoing builds; others start with a single integration and expand as we uncover new leverage points together. The relationship is fluid by design.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long do projects usually take?',
    answer:
      'It depends on what we\'re building. Strategy and consulting engagements typically run one to two weeks. Custom builds and integrations range from two to eight weeks depending on scope and complexity. Training is flexible — structured around your team\'s pace and depth of need. We scope honestly and ship fast, but never at the expense of craft.',
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between Consulting and Training?",
    answer:
      'Consulting delivers strategy for you — assessments, roadmaps, architecture decisions, and recommendations tailored to your organization. Training builds capability in you — hands-on sessions that develop your team\'s AI fluency so they can evaluate, adopt, and build with confidence on their own. One gives you the map; the other teaches you to navigate.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you build custom AI tools or integrate existing ones?',
    answer:
      'Both, and we\'re pragmatic about it. When a best-in-class tool already exists and fits the need, we integrate it. When nothing on the market solves the actual problem, we build. There\'s no ego in the decision — only the question of what creates the most leverage for you with the least unnecessary complexity.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What industries do you work with?',
    answer:
      "We're industry-agnostic. Our value is in deep AI expertise — understanding what's possible, what's practical, and what will compound over time — not in any single vertical. We've worked across sectors and find that the most interesting problems tend to come from teams operating at the edges of what AI can do, regardless of industry.",
  },
  {
    question: 'What does "aligned intelligence" mean?',
    answer:
      "It means AI that's shaped to your specific goals — not generic tools bolted onto existing workflows. We design systems where human judgment and AI capability reinforce each other: your taste, your domain expertise, and your strategic intent remain the guiding forces, while AI amplifies what you can execute. Intelligence without alignment is just noise.",
  },
  {
    question: 'How is Manas different from other AI agencies?',
    answer:
      'Manas is a studio, not a body shop. We\'re deliberately small, founder-led, and opinionated — guided by eight core beliefs about where AI is taking the economy and what it means to build well within that shift. Every engagement gets real depth: design taste paired with engineering rigor, strategic clarity with fast execution. There are no junior handoffs, no templated playbooks. We bring precision, leverage, and taste to everything we touch.',
